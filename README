Cyrus asked me to hack together a script for new Twitter that can translate
individual tweets on the Twitter webpage.

Here's the first version of it. I'm afraid it's cargo cult Javascript, clumsily
assembled from:

Jack Hsu's original Twitter Translate:

Cyrus's adopted version:

Chilla42o's modern TweetFilter:

The *dream* would be a script that did this automatically, for all tweets on th
page that don't look like they're in the language of the browser user. Feel
free to mess with the code to make that dream come alive.
